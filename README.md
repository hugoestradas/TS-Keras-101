Description:

For this Keras Model, I’m going to create a very simple neural network that learns how to divide these two sets of data.

I am going to use a test set generator to create these clusters of data.

For one set the class is 1, and for the other set the class is 0.
Looking at this distribution it may seem that coming up with a line that divides these set is at best a trivial task. But I want the line that divides the set to be the best based on their distribution value in each cluster.

I will create a model that defines the optimal separation between these two clusters of data.
